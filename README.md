## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
      
    Favorite applications and features:
      1. Pinterest
         - Content suggested based on the most updated board
         - Search based on skin tone
         - In the search tab there are pictures grouped into different categories that would allow you to automatically add the suggested pictures to that      
           specific board.
      3. TikTok
         - For you page algorithm
         - Repost feature 
         - Saving videos in different folders 
      4. Instagram
         - Deleting Messages
         - Close Friends
         - Explore Page 
      5. Netflix
         - Tailors the movie suggestions to your liking
         - New recommendations based on what everyone is watching, allowing users to discover new movies or genres.

   ## App Idea

    If I were to create an app, it would be dedicated to helping people manage their gym journeys. Users would be able to track weight progression, daily calorie  
    intake, protein intake, and BMI. For women, the app would also offer menstrual cycle tracking.
    
    The app would have the feel of a social media platform, allowing people to post workout suggestions, techniques for targeting specific muscles, and even 
    fashion inspiration by showcasing their gym outfits. Users could build a following based on their contributions.
    
    This platform would essentially incorporate three apps into one, with icons at the bottom for easy switching between the different features:
    
    1. Tracking the menstrual cycle (this tab would only be accessible based on the gender selected during the sign-up process).
    2. Tracking workout and dietary habits.
    3. A section for video suggestions, pictures, and the ability to save posts to different folders or mood boards, similar to Pinterest.
    
    ## Primary features I would focus on include:
    
    - An algorithm based on workout preferences and search history.
    - Mood boards for different inspirations (clothing, diet, and workout suggestions).
    - A unique interface that intuitively combines all these elements.
